##Disclaimer
The ideas presented in this article borrows elements from Prof. Harold Thwaites’s (Consultant Professor & Director of the 3CDI, University Malaya) talk titled: *Theory & Praxis of Heritage Science: What do we learn when we can digitize EVERYTHING?* at the 2nd Singapore Heritage Science Conference given in NTU. The proposed course content, however, builds largely on Ernie’s conversations and involvements with the Responsible Business Forum 2014, Happiness Economics, data analytics, cultural groups, tech education and private tuition.

This curriculum has been designed by Ernie, Co-founder and CEO of Artisnap Private Limited as well as Education Lead of Tech Society.

## What is Heritage Science?

It is the capturing, accessing, interpreting, conserving and managing of cultural heritage.

## What are its outcomes?

Driven by the spirit of scientific inquiry, Heritage Science aims to generate new forms of knowledge and cultural consumption in these 5 key question areas:

1.	How can creative approaches extend and enhance our experiences of heritage and enable new forms of interpretation and knowledge exchange?

2.	How can heritage science contribute to a nation’s cultural heritage (tangible/intangible) prosperity?

3.	What social and economic impacts can our evolving digital histories have on a global scale?

4.	What forms of heritage science approaches can help enable an increased digital inclusion and participation of excluded groups?

5.	How much information is enough?

This Heritage Science curriculum aims to groom a pool of cultural entrepreneurs for Singapore. The end goal is Singapore as a Heritage Hub, in which we will be able to inform, lead and consult on matters ranging from capturing heritage to cultural reproduction. In research terms, research clusters in Singapore will be able to contribute to the domains listed below:

Examples of layman deliverables, based on the multi-year Mask Project by Harold Thwaites:

## What are its methods?
Drawing on multi-disciplinary expertise from various fields, Heritage Science is made possible by the meeting of different areas of study; its method is the Renaissance method.

## How (Pedagogy)?

BAD-S

> B: Blended Learning + Learning by Failing or Jugaad

> A: Assessment for Learning

> D: Data Analytics

> S: Storytelling

## Principles
* These course modules are designed to be independent of each other, but a completion of which should entitle one to earn a Minor in Heritage Science.
* Course content will be built in consultation with Masters and will largely be delivered online.
* The Teacher’s role in all instances is to function as a facilitator and “classroom hours” will take a flipped approach in which students work on their assignments together in class.
* Formal “teaching” will consist of no longer than 3 hours consecutively; with 15-minute stand-up Scrum meetings are the beginning of every lesson, and 1-2 hours of Lean Coffee at the end to transfer learning.
* Peer learning will be encouraged.
* To promote student’s participation, game elements such as Badges, Streaks and Combos will be introduced where they may earn virtual credits by completing associated challenges.
*	A Leaderboard showcases every team’s standing.
